#
# This template will be used when a new file is created.
#
# Codimension supports an IDE-wide template file and project-specific template
# files for each project. If a project is loaded then codimension checks the
# project-specific template file and IDE-wide one in this order. The first one
# found is used to create a new file. If no project is loaded then only the
# IDE-wide template file is checked.
# The IDE-wide template file is stored in the codimension settings directory
# while project-specific template files are stored in the top project
# directory. In both cases the template file is called 'template.py'.
#
# The following variables will be replaced with actual values if
# they are found in the template:
#
# $projectdate     Project creation date     (*)
# $author          Project author            (*)
# $license         Project license           (*)
# $copyright       Project copyright string  (*)
# $version         Project version           (*)
# $email           Project author e-mail     (*)
# $description     Project description       (*)
# $date            Current date
# $time            Current time
# $user            Current user name
#
# Note: variables marked with (*) are available only for the project-specific
#       templates. The values for the variables are taken from the project
#       properties dialogue.
